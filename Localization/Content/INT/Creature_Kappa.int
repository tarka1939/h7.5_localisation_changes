mLore="Kappas are minor Water Spirits, bound to a material shape by their alliance with the Naga priesthood. They are jokingly desribed as the offspring of a toad and a turtle due to their unusual appearance, but the Nagas know that martial talents of these strange creatures should not be underestimated. Their carefree demeanor, which often amuses travellers from other lands, hides agility and strength, so it is not recommended to test Kappas' patience. Especially, in an attempt to check the truth of rumors about consequences of draining water-filled indentations on the top of their heads."
