mName="Oblivion Archon"
mLore="After the resumption of the Elder Wars, Oblivion Archons were supposed to become the trump card of Erebos in his confrontation against the forces of Light, but the death of the main instigators of the ancient conflict, including himself, put an end to those plans. Over the following centuries, massive constructs that combined the powers of Darkness and Void were stored in the secret workshop of Master of Assassins, until Vayaron revealed its location to Sylsai, who got his hands on the perfect torture devices. The leader of the Soulscar Ð¡lan finds most satisfaction in watching the sinister mechanisms consume the souls of captured Dwarves, Dark Elves, and Faceless to banish his enemies into oblivion."

It is said that Malassa's blood is included in the poison that covers Emissary's blade, causing the victims to experience endless agony, while their flesh and bones rapidly dissolve without a trace."
