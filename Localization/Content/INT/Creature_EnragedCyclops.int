mName="Enraged Cyclops"

mLore="Though the Cyclopes are by nature calm with a child-like simplicity, when they are hurt (physically or emotionally), they develop an explosive and terrifying rage, born from their chaos-tainted blood. This makes them dangerous to everyone, their own kind included. A select few Cyclopes can intuitively channel this rage through their “Evil Eye” to incinerate their enemies from a distance.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n2 Dragon Blood Crystal \n1 Starsilver"
