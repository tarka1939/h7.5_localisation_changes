mLore="Behemoths are highly social creatures. Younger behemoths are usually the hunters of the group, while the older specimens, recognizable to their grey fur, are tasked with guard duty. Woe to the imprudent who trespasses on the group’s territory: Ancient Behemoths are bigger, fiercer, more cunning – and surprisingly agile for such hulking creatures.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n2 Dragon Steel \n1 Shadowsteel"
