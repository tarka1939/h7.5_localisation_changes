mName="Shantiri Titan"

mLore="The first Titans were built by the Shantiris during the wars of the Mythic Age. Enormous and complex constructs animated by magic, most of them fell or disappeared during the great wars of that period. A few precious specimens escaped destruction, and are eagerly sought after by the Wizards, especially those of House Materia. Of course, in some even rarer cases, the Shantiri Titan is not only intact, but still "alive"... and not always happy to have been disturbed.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n3 Starsilver \n1 Dragon Blood Crystal"
