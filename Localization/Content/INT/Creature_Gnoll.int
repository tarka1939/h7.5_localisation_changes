mName="Gnoll"
mLore="Gnolls are one of many types of Beastmen created by the Mages of House Chimera after they mastered the art of cross-species fusion. Half-human, half-hyena, they were designed to serve as trackers, capable of tirelessly pursuing the scent of the enemy. But once they have found the enemy, they prefer to attack from afar by throwing knives."
