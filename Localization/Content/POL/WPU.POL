mText="Many of Sur (as members of the While Council of Alliance call themselves) believe that the first Xel beings arrived on their native planet Eb from a nearby nebula, which has never been entirely explored. That time, all the factions of C`sura behaved separately, being in a persistent conflict. Only the coming of a powerful enemy made these factions unit together. Immediately, enemies became allies.\n\nThe first conflict was more likely a massacre than a battle and unprepared Sur tasted the power and resolve of this parasitic space race. However, instead of death, it meant endless enslavement for defeated Sur. Step by step, Xel started to control bodies and minds of their hosts. In the end, even the particular members of the Council stood against each other and the only “rescue” was entire destruction of host bodies. Those who survived without being enslaved escaped to the nearby Yeg Moon and contacted other factions, creating thus the - later famous - C`sura Alliance.\n\nOpinions about finding a radical solution were more and more frequent. Pa`Raktos, later known as the Architect, belonged to supporters of these ideas. And it was exactly he who came with an idea to create an ultimate weapon which would destroy Xel once and forever. The Council finally agreed and the work on the Messiah could start.\n\nXel had already controlled the whole Eb and everything indicated they would leave the planet soon towards the further colonisation. The Messiah was also prepared but nobody wanted to bear responsibility for millions of victims which would die together with Xel. Eventually, Pa`Raktos himself took all responsibility and The Messiah was launched, even through many protests. The result of the weapon was perfect – it had really engulfed the whole planet. Everybody was celebrating defeat of Xel and mourning at dead relatives at the same time.\n\nThe Architect, fascinated by destructive power of the weapon, left to a near nebula in a hope he could disappear and get the necessary time for loading the Messiah again. But he was confronted with the primordial Xel – an immaterial entity which used him as its host. So the Architect left the weapon in the nebula to divert attention from himself and he headed in a smaller spaceship towards the wormhole.\n\nAfter finding the Messiah in the nebula, it was decided to modify it in order to be executable only by someone from Sur who would get the permission from all members of the Council. Also a new condition was assigned: absence of anyone on the target planet. So the Messiah had been deactivated and hidden on a safe place on the Yeg Moon, in a hope it might be possible to launch it never more.\n\nAt the same time, a battle-cruiser was sent to chase escaping Pa`Raktos who was the last host of the Xel entity. Passing through the wormhole damaged his ship enough to make him force land on the nearest planet. Without any control over the ship, it was more like a falling-stone than a landing. He created a huge crater on the north continent and the alloy in the mantle of his spaceship sealed him inside. So he created thus his own tomb, imprisoning his own dead body, as well as the Xel entity.\n\nC`sura reached their aim. After short survey on the place of impact, their sensitive devices found no activity. So they decided to cover the whole place and created massive mountains above the crater thanks to their abilities. It was decided that seven members of Sur would stay on the planet as eternal guardians. They named the world “Mon`Dalar”, which means “Eternal Guard”, and they changed their appearance into impressive creatures – dragons, not to scare the nations living there, by their true appearance.\n\nAs the time passed, dragon guardians slowly started to forget horrible things they had experienced. On the contrary, they enjoyed how the countries worshipped them as their gods. They sent a message to their native planet from time to time but there was nothing to report more and more often. Xel had never appeared again and the massive mountains have been settled by first tribes.\n\nThousands of years have passed and only shadows became from once powerful and proud Sur. And it was exactly that moment Xel entity had been waiting for, poisoning minds of all living creatures for centuries in the Iron Mountains’ surroundings. Using the name Arkath, this false dragon god was ordering dwarves to dig deeper and deeper. It helped them to get rare metals which had been created during the spaceship fall and which were the only ones being able to break through the sealed mantle.\n\nIn the day of opening the Xel tomb, a furious storm of red lightnings rose across the whole world. All nations turned immediately to their gods to help them but they kept silent. Surprised by something they hadn’t been prepared for, they rather escaped to the depths of cold space. Humans, elves, dwarves and other nations had to rely on themselves. And thousands of mutated creatures were coming towards them from the Iron Mountains, having no mercy..."

I’m Ra-mei Shebec, but my friends call me just “Ra”. I come from Kiwa, the desert town, and I usually spend my time sorting my notes and writing scientific books from all corners of Mondalar.  I’d say I’m a traveler-adventurer, and when it comes to exploring new things, I’m afraid of almost nothing… except for furry primeval forest spiders—they’re truly disgusting!\n\nWhen I heard about the strange behavior of Yzgar dwarves, I had to travel there, to the Iron Mountains, to look into it more closely. The port town Kog-Badur readily welcomed me—I was offered the local Bear beer and I got drunk as a sailor.  Next morning, a strong hangover as well as a Grumdumir, with the message that everything was prepared, was waiting for me. Only after I was silent for a minute, trying to recover my failing memory, I could remember that I had paid him to accompany me to the mountains.\n\nWe set off at dawn the next day. The hangover was even stronger than the Black Bear of Thorrim! The foggy morning amplified the choking atmosphere enveloping us. We reached the place where, according to Grumdumir, “ominous howl” and “frosty whispering” could be rapidly heard. But then we slowed down, and we even stopped for a while. Consequently, I caught myself huddling behind Grundumir, not to be seen… behind the dwarf!\n\nA fascinating scene started exactly in front of us, full of obscure shrieks, howling, and later, quiet whispering—or rather, an invocation.\n\nOn top of all these things, red fires were dancing and some crooked creatures began casting shadows of endless anguish over us. I attempted to note down at least part of what these creatures were chanting again and again. I was able to find out later that it was an (intentionally?) altered dialect of an old dwarven language, and thanks to Grumdumir, we managed to translate it.\n\nAfter I returned to my room in the tavern, I was continually thinking about everything I had seen—the distorted bodies that could have once belonged to dwarves; the victims they had worshipped and kowtowed to; the rhythmic rumble of drums and their far-away expressions.\n\nThe night was full of nightmares. At one moment, I even felt that I heard a frosty whispering under my window.\n\nNext day, I decided to take a different path and get to the ritual place from the other side of the mountains. I thought we could use hide behind numerous boulders, getting thus closer. Even that time, Grumdumir let me know that the price I had paid him did not compensate the risk he had to undergo. So, I agreed and increased his reward. I was attracted by a mysterious force to that place, although being also deadly terrified. It was the first time I ever admitted that I had gone too far.\n\nThe way through the other side of the mountains was a bit longer, and when we reached the place, it was late afternoon. The sun was almost behind the sky-line and the realization that we had to go back in complete darkness didn’t help us at all. In spite of it, or because of it, we continued further and hid behind a cracked boulder that provided us as much protection as much as a great view. The ritual had already reached its full force when the wind turned over, blowing away from us! However, it did not seem like the creatures had a good sense of smell—or they did not let us know it, at least.\n\nApproximately one hour later, the drums calmed down and the creatures set out together towards the mountains, towing their pickaxes—which must have been used for excavating tunnels—behind. This was exactly the moment I had been waiting for. The sun had already set a long time ago, but the surrounding fires were still going down in the deepening darkness. I emerged out of my cover and came directly to the totem a victim was tethered to. Or more likely, what remained of it—because the creatures were cannibals. Except animal skulls, teeth, and bones, I could find nothing exceptional. As part of the documentation of my journey, I quickly jotted down the totem, adding it to my picture of one of the creatures.\n\nWhen I turned around to hint at Grumdumir to leave, I heard a quiet whispering behind me. I didn’t want to turn back and the scared eyes of the dwarf also told me not to do so. But my innate curiosity won, so I finally did it.\n\nI won’t forget the things I have seen until the end of my life (and I suspect not even after it). It’s hard to describe in our language what exactly I have seen; I even believe it’s not possible. A creature or an entity, hovering over the altar, having no stable shape. Sharp edges dissolving into shaky ones and changing back in a moment. It seemed as if it existed in different dimensions and spaces than we could describe or perceive. Its whispering was a deafening shout. My body, mind, and spirit in stunned torpor, my mouth wide open, I realized I was staring at a non-existent infinite, at a flaming frosty wasteland, at an absolute existence. I could, while not going mad, find no other words to describe the thing. It took ages... and then I finally lost consciousness...\n\nWhen they woke me up in my room, I was happy that everything was over. Immediately, I managed everything needed to return home, and I shipped away even that day. I brought the translated prayer, the two quick sketches I had colored during my way back, and memories that are surprisingly still terribly vivid.\n\nI called the creatures “Mordochs”, which means “worshipers” (but more likely meaning “fanatics”). According to later news, what the thing they had worshipped should have been, was no one other than Arkath, the dragon god, himself—a proud, strong, and fearless dragon. But I know that name has been taken by a creature which will scare me in my dreams for a really long time."
