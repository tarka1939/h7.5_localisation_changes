There is however a remote chance that his spirit is unable to undertake this journey and remains trapped on Ashan. When such a Spectral Dragon is spied on the surface of Ashan, the Necromancers undertake powerful rituals to find, capture, and bind the creature to their cause.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n2 Dragon Steel \n1 Dragon Blood Crystal"
