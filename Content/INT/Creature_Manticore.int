mLore="The Scorpicore is a Manticore that the Dark Elves exposed to an underground Nexus of dragonblood crystals attuned to the elemental powers of Darkness. This made the magical beast not only more powerful and more receptive to its master's commands, but also gave it an ability to fly thanks to the strong bat-like wings. Its poison corrodes the hardest materials like acid and cripples the muscles, inducing a progressive paralysis."
