mName="Kappa Shoya"
mLore="It is said that Kappas cannot dwell in muddy bodies of water and only the most venerable of them are able to purify the waters from which they obtain their strength. Bound to the most sacred rivers and lakes, Shoyas constantly strive to maintain the purity of their native element. In the process of purification they accumulate concentrated doses of spiritual toxins, which do not harm, but, on the contrary, give them strength. It allows them to make giant jumps and crush enemies with all their might."
