mLore="When a Beast Man is created, the result retains most of its human intelligence while inheriting the instincts and tendencies of its animal side. Gnoll hunters thus develop an opportunistic, not to say cowardly, side: they leave hand-to-hand combat to others and only attack with the certainty of not putting themselves in danger."
