mName="Bone Dragon"

mLore="The Bone Dragon is the most basic physical form of a dead dragon; it is a living fossil animated by only the simplest of primitive minds. Lacking its spirit, the Bone Dragon behaves like an unintelligent beast, erring on the face of Ashan, pushed by its basic survival instincts. As long as it’s not bound and controlled by Death Magic, it will wander aimlessly.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n1 Dragon Steel"
