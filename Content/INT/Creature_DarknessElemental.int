mName="Darkness Elemental"
mLore="Most of the Darkness Elementals develop in the depths of Ashan, in caves and tunnels and places of darkness where the influence of Malassa, the Dragon-Goddess of Darkness, is great. Caverns, crevices, and pits are all potential birthplaces. Spirits of obfuscation and mystery, their exact form is elusive. They often appear as moving shadows or areas within which light appears unusually wavery and feeble.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n1 Dragon Blood Crystal \n1 Shadowsteel"
