mLore="Like Goblins, Cyclopes were a "failure" in the Orc experiment. Born from the blood of major demons, they became monstrous giants, body and mind twisted by chaotic surges. While many factions would love to harness their power, only the Orcs have the strength, patience, and courage to “tame” them and give them a place in their villages as tireless workers, and on the battlefield as heavy shock troops and “siege engines”.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n1 Dragon Blood Crystal"
