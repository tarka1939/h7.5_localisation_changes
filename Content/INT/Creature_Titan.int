mLore="The few Shantiri Titans that have survived to the present day are almost objects of worship; they are carefully protected and studied by the Wizards who use them to create lesser imitations, which are still exceedingly powerful in battle. Their size and weight allow them to trample their enemies, and their earth-shaking fists can also channel devastating bolts of raw magic.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n2 Dragon Steel \n1 Shadowsteel"
