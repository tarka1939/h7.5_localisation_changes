mName="Fire Elemental"

mLore="When the anger of Arkath, the Dragon-God of Fire, grows great enough that it breaks the barrier between the Elemental Plane of Fire and the world of Ashan, this rage can create a wave of elemental magic that generates rash and ill-tempered Fire Elementals. The intensity and cause of the fire determine to an extent the personality and power of the Elemental. Most are born from spontaneous forest fires, others from unusual flows of lava, or volcanic eruptions.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n1 Dragon Steel"
