mLore="Half-humans and half-dolphins, the Mermaids were originally used to guard, scout, and sail the Wizards’ coasts. Unfortunately, the lands of the Seven Cities being mainly deserts meant that most Mermaids saw very little water, gradually devolving into little more than striking pets for preening masters. As a result, though the Mermaids did not take an active role in the Orc Revolts, they were more than happy to disappear in its aftermath. Since then they have lived more or less freely in the seas, having few natural predators and even fewer cares. On one thing they are implacable, however: their hatred of the Wizards and distrust of all land dwellers. Only the Naga and the wisest and most respectful of sea captains may hope to gain the grudging respect of these flighty and dangerous creatures."
