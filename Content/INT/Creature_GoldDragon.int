mName="Gold Dragon"

mLore="Gold Dragons are the Avatars of Elrath, the Dragon-God of Light. Majestic and powerful, these great feathered serpents are also elusive, rarely interacting with the other denizens of Ashan, even Elrath's worshippers. Some scholars claim it is because true light must remain an ideal, and therefore stay out of reach. Indeed, throughout history several knights have received the assistance of friendly Gold Dragons to accomplish virtuous quests.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n3 Dragon Blood Crystal \n1 Dragon Steel"
